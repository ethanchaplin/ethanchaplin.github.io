            <h3>Design Requirements</h3>
            <p>I identified the following as design goals for the interface</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Be able to upload audio files to listen to later</li>
                <li>Be able to add or remove goals to be checked off daily</li>
                <li>Set goals for a daily average of practice minutes</li>
                <li>Flexible layout for a customizable view</li>
                <li>The ability to track the same song over the course of several days/weeks</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>

            <h2>Element Descriptions</h2>
            <h2>Implementation Details</h2>
            <p>
                This project was built with Svelte. No external CSS or component libraries were used, all was built from scratch. Each element was a component, except for
                the sidebar and the navbar, which I kept within <code>App.svelte</code>.
            </p>
            <h2>Future Work</h2>
            <p>There's some things I would have changed/fixed right off the bat, but due to time constraints
               I was unable to address them without sacrificing other integral parts of the project.
            </p>
            <ul>
            </ul>
            <p>There's also functionality which I would've liked to implement, based off of feedback and my own desires for the project.</p>
