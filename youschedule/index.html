            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                YouSchedule is a fundamental redesign of a popularly used software application within the University of Cincinnati 
                for scheduling classes and planning credits towards graduation. With courses being removed or not available, we want 
                to enhance the self-sufficiency of students to schedule their classes for a semester. We also feel that if we are 
                eligible for certificate or minor (or at least close to being eligible for one), the enhancement will recommend 
                courses based on potential benefits for the student. 
            </p>
            <h2>Design</h2>
            <h3>Interviews</h3>
            <h4>Questions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    How confident do you feel about scheduling your classes for the next semester? 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do you have any problems with scheduling your classes? 
                <li>
                    What frustrates you must about the course scheduling process?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Would it interest you to have more features when making a decision about taking a specific course? 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do you feel more confident in your college career with what is currently available to you? 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Findings</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Initial findings with one interviewee revealed that they didn’t like the current way courses were scheduled in Catalyst. They were also shocked that they were eligible for a minor because they had a specific courseload that they already took and didn’t know it would apply to them. Frustration grew when they saw how much research they had to do and that nothing was immediately available from their academic advisor. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Several of the interviewees explained that they needed to jump back and forth between different applications that would have courseloads that were recommended. Because the applications were different, there were several time-out errors received or SSO would kick them out of one of the applications. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    One of the interviewees requested the ability to have additional courses that would contribute to a minor or a potential double major. Having courses available to see in one application would help cut down on relying on the academic advisor. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    An interviewee that does not attend the school asked if there was a way to incorporate AI into the application (merely as a suggestion). Having a chatbot to ask quick questions would be helpful because they had questions when they were in college and couldn’t get them answered before the course would fill up. It was explained to them that it would be a great idea to incorporate it into future deployments. 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Sketches</h3>
            <div class="sketches">
                <p>
                    In our initial sketches, we felt it was important to include a visual graph to show students 
                    how far they are into their current degree. This feature was included in a previous version 
                    of UC’s course planning site and has been removed from the current one. This feature allowed 
                    users to visually see how far they are into their current degree and provide motivation, so 
                    it was something we wanted to include in the redesign. Another feature which is not included on 
                    UC’s current site is the ability to add/view minors and certificates to their course planning. 
                    We felt that this was an important feature to add as it would allow users to see what options 
                    they have and how it could fit into their courses. Other information that we wanted to include 
                    was the student’s major, GPA, advisor, and a link to the “what if reports”.
                </p>
                <img src="./assets/image1.jpeg"/>
            </div>
            <div class="sketches">
                <img src="./assets/image2.png"/>
                <p>
                    When refining our sketches, there were some tweaks that we wanted to make so that the user could 
                    easily access the information that they wanted. While the first sketch had all the information 
                    we wanted to include, the layout could be confusing/overwhelming to users. In our second sketch, 
                    we had a dashboard layout that still would have user information and allow them to view/add courses. 
                    This new layout provides more of a visual separation and makes it easier for the user to navigate. 
                    For this design, we wanted the courses to be separated by semester and allow the user to add courses 
                    through a search or a dropdown menu. We also wanted to allow the user to view what their course 
                    schedule would look like and allow them to add their selected courses to their cart. An issue with
                    this design is implementation, as the search or dropdown menu could be difficult to do, given the
                    deadline.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="sketches">
                <p>
                    In our final sketch, we decided to add a section to the left that would hold the courses that the user 
                    would be able to drag and drop. This method would be easier to implement than the search or dropdown. 
                    We also moved the percentage of courses completed to the bottom, as in the previous sketch, the 
                    placement took up a lot of space.  We moved the student’s information to the top, because while it is 
                    important information, its not necessary to schedule classes. Finally, we added a button to the bottom 
                    of the screen that would allow students to see the class scheduler. This placement makes it easier for 
                    students to see and will make them more likely to use it.

                    is already accounted for in the semester views, they will no longer appear on the side, making
                    it a sort of a checkoff list.

                    which allows the user to directly schedule the courses for each semester.

                    Interface in which users can see each block of time every section takes up, and allows them to select which section they want to take. Once they
                    solidify a choice, it removes the other sections of the same class from the same time frame, as well as any other courses which would take up the same time.

            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>
                The application was implemented using a Svelte based front-end web framework, 
                and JavaScript. This was done to make it easy for the whole group to develop 
                using the framework and language set of this class. The libraries used include 
                the default base projects like svelte-js and Vite. The overall code structure 
                is set up to be easy to browse and add on to. The main .svelte files are located 
                within the /src/components folder, where the /src/lib folder holds the main JavaScript files, 
                as well as assets, layouts, and routes. This makes it easy to navigate, and modular to develop for. 
            </p>
            <h2>AI Use Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>
                AI was used in limited circumstances throughout the application. Mainly used for bug fixing, 
                and dummy data generation, we found the strengths of generative AI’s like ChatGPT very good for these areas. 
                Upon making any large changes, the generative nature of it would cause it to hallucinate, making 
                it limited in reliability. As such, we limited the scope of its use to just these two key areas. 
            </p>
            <h2>Future Work</h2>
            <li>
                Advanced course reccomendations based on major, other interests, other info etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                A quick way to transfer these classes to the scheduling tool, or an integrated schedular itself, allowing for a single button scheduling process.
            </li>
            <li>
                A popover for degree progress, showing detailed statistics on what is needed to graduate when clicking the top progress radial.
            </li>
            <li>
                Smart color coding and search-based filtering based upon subsection/tag of each course. Ie Chemistry, Science, Math, Computer Science, Degree Required, Elective, etc. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Detailed statistical data, and better class information popover, shown by a circular i button, to provide detailed data for those who may need it. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Class and teacher reviews system, allowing students to rate a class difficulty (especially useful for elective classes) which would show as a percentage or colored dot in the corner of the classes’ info box. 
            </li>
